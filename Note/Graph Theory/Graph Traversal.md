# Graph Traversal

> Graph traversal is an algorithm that visits each vertex in a graph without repeating any vertex. Graph traversal can be used to explore the structure and properties of a graph, to find paths between vertices, to check connectivity, to find cycles, etc. Graph traversal can also be applied to tree, array and other data structures, which are a special case of graphs.
